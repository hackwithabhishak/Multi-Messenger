# Multi-Messenger
In this Project I created a Multi-Messenger(web Application) through that multiple user can chat with each other at same time. Using Python Programming Language 

# Introduction
Teleconferencing or Chatting, is a method of using technology to bring
people and ideas “together” despite of the geographical barriers. The
technology has been available for year’s butte acceptance it was quit
recent. Our project is an example of a chat server. It is made up of 2
applications the client application, which runs on the user’s Pc and
server application, which runs on any Pc on the network. To start
chatting client should get connected to server where they can practice
two kinds of chatting, public one(message is broadcasted to all
connected users) and private one(between any 2 users only)and during
the last one security measures were taken
Basically our project is ‘One Server Multiple Clients’ program,which is
more like to the real world chat apps we use every day.To run the program,execute the ‘server.py’( after changing the bind()
address to the address of the server on which it is supposed to run.),
then execute the ‘client.py’(guess what? Samething here .But you will
have to add the server address in the connect() function here).
Of course you can have all of them running on the same system.
